The "Tip Calculator" application is a modern app for Android platform written in Kotlin. This application allows the user to input the amount of a bill (in dollars) and to specify the tip percentage (from 0 to 25%). It then calculates the tip and displays the total amount to pay (bill + tip). Along with tip calculation this application also provides the functionality of “bill splitting” based on number of persons. It also calculates the bill per amount per person and the tip share of each individual. 

The application was developed by applying Neilson's Usability Heuristics in order to achieve maximum efficiency with simple design.
This calculator is designed for CAD currency, and can be used by English speaking people when visiting restaurants, pubs, diners, etc.
